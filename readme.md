# Lambda Redshift Data Loader

If you are looking for a lambda to load data from s3 into your Redshift cluster, have a look at the AWSLabs github and look at their [Lambda Redshift Loader] (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-redshift-loader).  This project is to develop a similar lambda using Python.  The lambda in the AWSLabs repo is a Node.js Lambda.
